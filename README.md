# Shopify Customer Events & Shopify Pixels

Shopify has announced yet another phenomenal feature: Shopify Customer Events also known as Shopify Pixels. Our team at Analyzify has prepared open-source code blocks and tutorials for Shopify merchants to get the best out of this feature.

With this feature, Shopify merchants can: 

- Manage marketing & tracking pixels from one place, 
- Use Shopify's server-side event and Shopify's liquid objects to track events. 

More importantly, 3rd party tracking scripts will no longer be needed. Analyzify team has already prepared an open-source code block for Shopify & Google Analytics 4 integration. 

## Set up Google Analytics 4 using Shopify Pixels

You can use the GA4 code block in this repo and follow the tutorial on this page: [Shopify Pixels](https://analyzify.app/shopify-pixels) to achieve a Google Analyics 4 tracking including e-commerce events such as:
- Add to cart
- Product View
- Begin checkout
- Add payment info
- Purchase.

Analyzify's open-source solution doesn't only cover the events but also the metrics/dimensions along with them.
